			<p>Thank's for checking out my website!</p>
			<p>My name is Sunny, and I'm an Industrial Engineering student at Georgia Tech.</p>
		</h1>

		<p>I'm currently in the ISyE Senior Design process, and I'm graduating this December. The coursework at Georgia Tech is certainly not light, but I try to get myself involved in many activities in and out of school.<br>I'm in the Georgia Tech Wreck Racing club, where we build racecars, and I also participate in Georgia Tech Ultimate Frisbee.<br>Outside of school, I enjoy excercising through ultimate frisbee, tennis, bowling, hiking, and running.<br>Racecars are a large part of my life, and I enjoy building and driving racecars. I also instruct for many racing programs throughout the southeast as well as a teen driving program.<br>On the artistic side, I participate in local photography and videography, which I picked up in high school. I also learned how to play the piano and viola in high school and have made many friends through music. </p>

		<p>Below, you'll find some software and programming languages that I have experience with, along with a bar showing my comfort level with each.</p>

		<p>In addition, feel free to contact me with any of the buttons at the bottom of the page!</p>
